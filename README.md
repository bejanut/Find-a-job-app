# We are hiring!

Fully functioning application for finding a job, complete with support for Companies, Managers, Employees and Users looking for jobs.

To start the application, the main method from AplicationGUI should be run. In the login screen there are 3 types of users, managers, employees and users and an admin account.
To log as an admin the credentials are user:admin, pass: admin and for the rest of the accounts you can use their full name (found in the consumers.json) and use the password "password".

The back-end is developed using Java and different design patterns such as Singleton, Factory and Observer.

The front-end uses Swing and AWT and the application pages follow the flow of Androidâ€™s Activities.
